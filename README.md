Face recognition || Door Automation || Attendance system
In this project, we have used Raspberrypi4 model b, Servo motor, USB webcamera
We make use of "face_recognition" from python for face recognition
We used an image of 2 people to train the model. This project can be explained in 6 steps:
1) Face Detection
2) Face Alignment or projecting faces
3) Face Encodings
4) Face Recognition
5) Attendance Recordiing
